# Pilot-RCTOA - Repo for data and analysis script from pilot study conducted in preparation for full RCTOA

Script:

RCTOA Pilot Data Analysis - Imports data from 8 pilot subjects that completed RCT using bluetooth haptic device before switching to IMU device for feedback. Builds a regression model to predict KAM based on session by group with random intercept and slope by participant. Two plots are created: (1) KAM over sessions per subject (8 plots in total), (2) Estimated change in mean KAM from baseline across sessions
